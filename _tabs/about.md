# About Me

## Personal

I have two young boys, a beautiful wife, and two small dogs. I love warm beach trips and cozy winter cabins, and I’m actually writing this in front of a fire in a snow-covered cabin right now (11/29/25). I enjoy F1, football, UFC, video games, writing code, reading, rock climbing, traveling, and brewing lots of espresso.

## Work

I’m a Senior SRE with expert-level experience in AWS cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, Terraform/Tofu, CI/CD, observability, and full-stack software development, with a strong interest in AI integrations and emerging tooling. I’ve been in the industry for well over a decade. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science and have worked from early Sys Admin rack and stack days to full software engineering roles, DevOps, and SRE.
