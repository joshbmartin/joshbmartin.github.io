# March 22, 2020 SAA-C01 will retire

It's been roughly 10 years since I've gotten certified or even taken a test for that matter. That was back when I got my Net+ still in high school!

I've been wanting to go for this exam for about a year now. I've just recently finished this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/) by Ryan Kroonenburg. However, now that I'm done I feel like my skills are still lacking. Might as well make a list of things I need to work on.

Things to do:

- Work through all labs again
- VPC work especially (setting up subnets, route tables, NACLs, etc)
- Whitepaper refresh
- End section Exam questions reviewed.
- Work through Practice Tests from Jon Bonso

I have roughyl 3 weeks until the exam will refresh. Once I work through the above items I'm hoping to have at least 2 chances to schedule my exam. Time to get to work!
