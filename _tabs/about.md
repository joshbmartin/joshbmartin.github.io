## Personal

I have two young boys, a beautiful wife, and two small dogs. I enjoy F1, football, UFC, video games, writing code, reading, rock climbing, traveling, and brewing lots of espresso. Some of the books I've read recently in no particular order (affiliate links below, support if you want!)

## Work

I’m a Senior SRE with expert-level experience in AWS cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, Terraform/Tofu, CI/CD, observability, and full-stack software development. I have a strong interest in AI and emerging technologies. I’ve been in the industry for well over a decade. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science and have worked from early Sys Admin rack and stack days to full software engineering roles, DevOps, and SRE. More recently I've been writing Ruby, Typescript, Javascript and Go.
